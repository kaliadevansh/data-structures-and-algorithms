## Challenges

### Reverse an Array

The challenge is for Class 01.

#### Challenge

Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods 
available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

#### Approach & Efficiency

The array is being passed as an argument to the function.
The array is already been passed as an argument. Hence, insertion sort while inserting data from the user is not a viable apprach.
Ideal approach would be to read the input array and manipulate data in-place. The details are in the solution
